# 🚀 Quick Start (TL;DR)

### 🛠️ Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed on your host machine:
- **Docker Desktop** (or Docker Engine on Linux).
- **VS Code**.
- **Dev Containers Extension** (ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).
- **Godot Engine (4.x Mono/C#)**: Required locally for editor access and UI/Editor testing.

### ⚙️ How to Start
1. Open this project folder in **VS Code**.
2. Press `F1` (or `Ctrl+Shift+P`) and select: **Dev Containers: Reopen in Container**.
3. Ensure your `GEMINI_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set in your host environment or a `.env` file for AI features. (Not mandatory).
4. Use your preferred AI chat code assist (Copilot, Gemini, Qwen, Cline, Continue...) or the OpenCode CLI agent.
5. **CLI Shortcuts:** Use `opencode` for the AI agent or `context-mode .` to refresh LLM context.

### 🧪 Initial Validation
Inside the container terminal, run:
```bash
dotnet test && bash AI/script/validate.sh
```

* IDEs errors like "GDScript server not connected" are expected.

# 🧠 How to work on this project

1. **Initialize the Agent:** Choose a role and mode from `AI/agent_mode.md` (e.g., "Initialize as Architect in FULL mode").
2. **Follow the Assembly Line:**
   * **Planner:** Discovery with PO → Updates `design/gdd.md` and `roadmap.md`.
   * **Architect:** Refines `design/contracts` (linking tasks) and decomposes features into `AI/tasks/XXX.md`.
   * **Tester (Red):** Writes failing tests and logs results in `AI/logs/`.
   * **Developer:** Implements minimal logic to turn the tests green locally.
   * **Tester (Done):** Final validation against contracts → Marks Task as DONE.
   * **Reviewer:** Final Audit → Compresses context and updates `design/review.md`.
3. **Source of Truth:** 
   * `AI/task.md` points to the active task.
   * `AI/context.md` defines the technical rules.
   * `design/contracts/` defines the behavioral requirements.

👉 Everything is guided by **Specialized Agents + TDD + Tasks**

## 🛠 Validation Loop & Feedback Cycle (SDD)

This project strictly adheres to **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** principles. In this workflow, the specification is the single source of truth, and code is treated as a secondary artifact derived from it. To ensure system integrity when working with AI agents, we implement a rigorous feedback loop:

### 1. Validation Scripts as Reality Anchors
Consistent with the "Clean Code for AI Agents" philosophy, AI output must be validated by deterministic tools. Our automated scripts close the gap between generation and correctness:
* `AI/script/validate.sh`: Performs static analysis and contract integrity checks.
* `AI/script/gdunit.sh` & `xunit.sh`: Ensure that C#/Godot implementations satisfy technical requirements without hallucinations.

### 2. Spec-First & TDD Workflow
No agent is authorized to write implementation code unless:
1.  The contract in `design/contracts/` has been validated.
2.  Unit tests (TDD) are defined and failing.
3.  The validation scripts provide the final "green light" for task completion.

> **Golden Rule:** Task success is not defined by how "correct" the code looks, but by passing the validation scripts. This eliminates semantic noise and focuses on technical precision.

# 🔄 Development flow

1. **Planner:** Discovery with PO → Updates `design/gdd.md` and `roadmap.md`.
2. **Architect:** Contract formalization (linking tasks) → Decomposes into `AI/tasks/XXX.md` (via `AI/script/task-init.sh`).
3. **Tester (Red):** Reads Task → Writes failing tests → Logs results in `AI/logs/`.
4. **Developer:** Reads Task + Logs → Implements minimal code → Verifies Green state locally.
5. **Tester (Done):** Final validation against contracts → Marks Task as DONE.
6. **Reviewer:** Audits the handoff → Compresses context into `design/review.md` → Cleans agent states.
